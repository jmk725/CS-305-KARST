Artemis Financial, a consulting firm specializing in savings, retirement, investments, and insurance, sought to modernize its infrastructure by developing a RESTful web API. Given the sensitivity of financial data, the company required robust security to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. My assessment revealed critical vulnerabilities, including a lack of input validation, missing encryption, outdated dependencies, and the absence of structured exception handling. To address these issues, I applied secure coding practices, upgraded cryptographic and logging libraries, implemented SHA-256 hashing, and introduced TLS encryption. This work aligned with OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines and ensured that client and server interactions were validated, encrypted, and resilient against common threats such as XSS and injection attacks.

The assessment process included both manual code reviews and static vulnerability scans using OSSINDEX. While identifying relevant CVEs and mapping them to specific dependencies was challenging, these efforts were vital to understanding and mitigating risk. I validated functionality by testing the application in Eclipse, confirming endpoint behavior, and monitoring error logs to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. The use of tools like Java MessageDigest, Java Keytool, Maven, and OWASP guidelines proved valuable and will benefit future development efforts. This project serves as strong evidence of my ability to identify and mitigate software vulnerabilities, and I would proudly share the vulnerability report and secure refactored code with future employers as a demonstration of my secure development skills.
